# Feature Selection in Scikit-learn

When building a supervised machine learning model, we gather features that are potentially useful for predicting the outcome. Not all features are going to end up being helpful in building the model. Itâ€™s often practical to filter out non-predictive features and keep the model lean so that the model is faster, easier to explain to stakeholders and simpler to productionise.

Code in feature-selection.py compares model performance for features selected with different methods in Scikit-learn. It demonstrates a few simple ways to weed out features that are not useful in predicting the outcome and select the features that contribute more.
